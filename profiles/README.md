# profiles - give your staff a face
A wise man told me once: "People need people". Showing your staff
on your website helps your customers to connect and relate to
them, making the overall experience a lot more pleasant.

Add social media accounts and blogs to show awesome stuff they do.

You can either associate them with real user accounts in `django.contrib.auth`
or use the app on its own.

##### Installation
You do not have to add any configuration options. Just include `profiles`
in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
