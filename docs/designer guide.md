# Designer Guide
You need a basic understanding of Django to get catntent up and running but nearly
none, if you only want to design a template. Take a quick look at Djangos template
language. If you ever worked with any templating language you should have no
problem with it.

Check out the template directory. There you will find a basic
template, nearly without markup. Theoretically you could just edit `base.html`
and `static/css/main.css` and have a decent design. Of course, you will start
editing application specific templates in the corresponding subdirectory for a
better layout and design, but you get the point.
