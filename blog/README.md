# Publish whatever you want
You have the option to create articles, notes, links or images.
Thanks to different content types you can style you posts depending
on what you posted.

Tags and categories are supported. With template tags you can include
them on any part of your site.

##### Installation
You do not have to add any configuration options. Just include `blog`
in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

## ToDo

- Add template tags for recent posts
- Internal comment support (low priority - [reason why][1])
