# dashboard
With dashboard you get a user friendly frontend for your CMS.
While Djangos admin interface provides great functionality, it is
not the best user experience or exceptionally beautiful. Dashboard
aims to fix this.

##### Installation
You do not have to add any configuration options. Just include 
`dashboard` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
