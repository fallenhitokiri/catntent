# catntent
catntent provides a solid foundation for websites based on Django.
Most of the websites we have build share some common things, like
a news system, a message form and some static pages.

We build catntent as foundation for those projects. Just add the
applications you need, create a template and add focus on the
interesting part of your work.

## requirements
For a detailed list see ```requirements.txt```. Basically catntent
runs on a pretty simple Django stack without any obscure 3rd party
requirements which are only updated if you sacrify a goat on a
night with full moon.
