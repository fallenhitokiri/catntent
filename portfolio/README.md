# portfolio - show off your awesome work
You can show your projects to the whole world with images and summaries to help
your visitors to quickly scan what you have done. Tell everyone what you
used to accomplish your awesome piece of work. You can, for example, add
your framework or markup language you used for your social media site or which
engine you put in your newest 10 second car.

Add your clients with their logos and testimonials either to your project or
as a separate page.

##### Installation
You do not have to add any configuration options. Just include `portfolio`
in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

## ToDo

- views to browse projects by tech / job
- category support?
- template tags for testimonials and clients
